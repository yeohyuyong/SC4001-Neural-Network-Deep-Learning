# Ensemble Deep Learning Models for Flower Species Classification

## Project Overview

This project focused on classifying flower species from a challenging visual dataset using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Background

The task required accurate classification of flower species in the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset, known for its visual complexity. Baseline models such as SVM showed limited performance for this dataset.

## Key Contributions

- Developed deep learning solutions tailored to the Oxford Flowers 102 classification task.
- Built an ensemble of VGG16, VGG19, and DeiT models in Python to enhance accuracy.
- Implemented and combined these models to leverage complementary strengths.

## Results

- Delivered a test accuracy of 80.71%, significantly surpassing the original SVM model accuracy of 72.8%.
